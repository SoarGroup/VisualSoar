<H1>Visual Soar User's Manual</H1>

<H2>What is Visual Soar?</H2>

<P>Visual Soar is a development environment for Soar applications.  It is written
in Java which means in order to run Visual Soar you must have a Java Runtime
Environment installed.</P>

<H2>What does Visual Soar do?</H2>

<P>Visual Soar contains tools that directly support many Soar related programming
tasks.  For example, creation of the operator heirarchy, maintence of the source tree,
along with support for templates.  In addition, upon supplying Visual Soar with information
about what you expect to be in working memory, Visual Soar can check to make sure your 
productions are consistent, and in some cases complete attribute or values for you.</P>

<H2>Key Components</H2>

<IMG SRC="visualsoar.jpg">

<P>The three key components of Visual Soar are the operator window, rule editor, and
data map.  The operator window displays the heirarchy of operators you have in your
system.  The rule editor allows you to edit and manipulate rules for the operators.
The data map displays the all possible structures that might exist in working memory 
when the rules are supposed to fire.</P>

<!--------------------------------- Operator Window ---------------------------------->
<H2>Operator Window</H2>
<IMG SRC="operatorwindow.jpg">

<P>The operator window is where you define the structure of your system.  It
directly supports subgoaling and a heirarchy of operators.  Here is where you
directly manipulate the logical structure of your system.  Entities that exist
in this system are:
</P>
<ul>
<li>The root
<li>Operators
<li>Files
<li>Folders
</ul>

<P>The root, the basis of the project, and will be named the same thing as what you
called your project.  You can add suboperators to the root, and access the top-state
view of the data map from the root.</P>

<P>Operators come in three flavors: high-level, low-level, and linked.  High-level operators are ones
that produce a substate and have suboperators.  Low-level operators produce no substate.  Linked 
operators are operators with the same name as another high-level operator in the system, and 
produce the same substate.  Every type of operator has an associated rule file where productions 
associated with that operator are saved.  High-level operators also have an associated view of the data 
map where the suboperator productions will be checked against.</P>

<P>Files aid organization.  Files are where you place things that are to be read into the
system, but are not productions, productions that are not assciated with any operator, and
productions that relate to state rather than operators (elaborations) among others.
The only place where user's can add file entities is under the elaborations folder.  An
elaborations file is automatically created for you under a high-level operator.  If
you do not want the file parsed by a <B>Check All Productions Command</B>, start the name
of the file with an &quot;_&quot;.  Note, this will also work for operators.</P>

<P>Folders are also organizational aids.  There are always two, <B>elaborations</B> and <B>all</B>.  <B>All</B> is
a place to put operators that don't belong in any particular place in heirarchy because they
can fire in all states.  <B>Elaborations</B> is a folder that contain files with productions that 
relate to the top-state, fire in all possible states, or other productions that do not fit well
within the hierarchy.</P>

<!----------------------------------------------- Rule Editor ------------------------------> 
<H2>Rule Editor</H2>
<IMG SRC="ruleeditor.jpg">

<P>The rule editor allows you to edit the actual productions associated with operator or file.
It provides basic text editing facilities.  It also allows for template insertion along with
a tab-completion type facility called "soar complete" which will complete some attribute or values for
you.</P>


<!----------------------------------------------- Data Map --------------------------------->
<H2>Data Map</H2>
<IMG SRC="datamap.jpg">

<P>The data map provides a way to enter information about what you expect to be in
working memory when a production fires.  It is supposed to represent the
superset of all things that can be in working memory.  Visual Soar uses this information
to make sure your productions are consistent with this data map.  The data map also uses type
information to make sure values have the right type.<P>

<P>The different value types you can create in the data map are:</P>

<ul>
<li>Identifiers
<li>Enumerations
<li>Integers
<li>Floats
<li>Strings
</ul>

<P>An identifier is equivalent to a soar identifier and can have a value.</P>
<P>An enumeration is usually an enumeration of strings that represent possible
values for that attribute.</P>
<P>An integer is an integer number that is either ranged or not.</P>
<P>A float is a floating point number that is either ranged or not.</P>
<P>A string can be basically anything besides an identifier.</P>

<P>Note on mixed types: sometimes attributes have mixed-type values.  You can
simulate that by creating more than one attribute-value with the same attribute
name but different value types.</P>

<!----------------------------------------- Creating A Tank Agent ------------------->
<H2>A Run Through</H2>

<P>To see how these components interact in the creation of a real system, we will
be creating a wandering agent for Tank Soar.</P>

<H3>Creating a new agent:</H3>
<P>
The first thing to do to create your agent is select <B>New Project...</B> from 
the <B>File</B> menu (or hit <B>ctrl n</B>). A new agent dialog will come up; 
type in the name of your agent. I'm going to call mine <B>Alphonse</B>. Then 
either browse or type in your agent's path. Since I have tanksoar installed in 
my c:\temp\tank\TankSoar24\ directory, I chose 
<B>c:\temp\tank\TankSoar24\agents</B> for my agent's path. Then hit <B>New</B> 
to create the agent.
<P>
The operator window opens with our new agent. By default Visual Soar creates 
two folders: <B>all</B>, and <B>elaborations</B>. Along with the _firstload file, which
will be the first file to load.  The <B>all</B> folder is used to create operators that don't fit 
within the operator hierarchy and the elaboration folder is used to add elaborations 
that are either associated with the top-state or common to all states.
<P>
Next, we will open the data map for our top-state, so right-click on the root 
node of the operator window, which in my case is <B>Alphonse</B> and select 
<B>Open Datamap</B> from the context menu.
<P>
The DataMap window opens in the right view pane. Now, we will add common 
attribute-values. Expand the <B>io</B> attribute.  You should see <B>input-link</B> 
and <B>output-link</B>.  Right-click on <B>input-link</B>.  A context menu will come
up asking you what attribute-values you want to add.  Select <B>Add Identifier...</B>. 
In the dialog, type in for the attribute name: <B>blocked</B> and hit <B>Ok</B>.
You should now see the attribute <B>blocked</B> hanging off the <B>input-link</B>.  You
might need to expand the input-link to see it.  You now have the basics of adding attribute
values to the data map.  Something to note, attribute-values can be linked, that is a new attribute
is created but it points to the same value as another attribute. 
Attributes can be linked by ctrl-shift dragging attribute-values to the 
new desired parent in the data map (this also works across different views/windows of the data map). 
If a link is made to a primitive WME (anything
besides an identifier) it's behavior is the same as making an independent copy.
However, if a link is made to an identifier, the name of the link and original
node will be independent, but their children will be shared.
</P>

<! IMG src="sampledm.png"> 
<H4>A datamap with the io link entered</H4>

<P>When Visual Soar created your project, it created some productions to set up the
type of task decomposition that Visual Soar supports.  These productions create a top-state link
on all states.  Name the substate the same thing as the selected superstate operator.  The last
thing they do is name the top-state the same thing as your project name.  New data map views
are created assuming these productions exist.  So you probably shouldn't modify them.  These
productions are found in the <B>elaborations</B> folder.  They are in the <B>_all</B> and 
<B>top-state</B> files.  When you right-click on <B>_all</B> and select <B>Open Rules</B>
You should see a rule editor open with the following productions:
</P>
<CODE><PRE>
sp {elaborate*state*name
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate.operator.name &lt;name&gt;)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^name &lt;name&gt;)
}

sp {elaborate*state*top-state
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate.top-state &lt;ts&gt;)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^top-state &lt;ts&gt;)
}
</PRE></CODE>
<P>
The <I>elaborate*state*name</I> production copies the operator name from
the superstate down to the substate.  The <I>elaborate*state*top-state</I> similarly
copies down the <B>top-state</B> link.  You can now close the rule editor.</P>

<P>
You might want to open the top-state file also, in this file you will find
the following productions:
</P>

<CODE><PRE>
sp {elaborate*top-state*name
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^superstate nil)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^name Alphonse)
}

sp {elaborate*top-state*top-state
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name Alphonse)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^top-state &lt;s&gt;)
}
</PRE></CODE>

<P>The <I>elaborate*top-state*name</I> names the top-state the same as our project name.
 The <I>elaborate*top-state*top-state</I> production makes the initial link from the top-state
to itself so that the <I>elaborate*state*top-state</I> will work.</P>

<H3>Setting up general application:</H3>
<P>
Re-open the <B>_all</B> rule file.  Our tank will be using a general io mechanism.  In order
for this to work we need to enter the following productions in the <B>_all</B> rule window.
</P>

<CODE><PRE>
sp {apply*operator*create-action-command
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;
              ^top-state.io.output-link &lt;ol&gt;)
   (&lt;o&gt; ^actions &lt;act&gt;)
   (&lt;act&gt; ^&lt;att&gt; &lt;value&gt;)
--&gt;
   (&lt;ol&gt; ^&lt;att&gt; &lt;value&gt;)
}

sp {apply*operator*remove-command
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;
	      ^top-state.io.output-link &lt;ol&gt;)
   (&lt;ol&gt; ^&lt;att&gt; &lt;value&gt;)
   (&lt;value&gt; ^status complete)
--&gt;
   (&lt;ol&gt; ^&lt;att&gt; &lt;value&gt; -)
}
</PRE></CODE>

<P>The <I>apply*operator*create-action-command</I> production copies the actions
off an operator and places them on the output-link through the top-state.  (Note that
the tutorial does this by copying a link to io to all substates and copying items to that.  
I feel that going through the top-state is a more general way of dealing with the problem and 
only slightly more verbose.  But the big advantage is that it is the way that 
Visual Soar directly supports so it saves you some work manipulating the data map.)
The <I>apply*operator*remove-command</I> checks the output-link for any completed commands
and frees up their memory.</P>

<H3>Specifing behavior of the tank - a wandering tank</H3>
<P>
Now that we have some ground rules set, we are ready to start specifying 
behavior for our tank. For this example, we will just build a wandering tank. So 
first thing we need to do is create a operator, so we right-click on 
<B>Alphonse</B> in the operator window and select <B>Add a Suboperator...</B> from 
the context menu, for the operator name type in <B>wander</B>.
<P>
Now wander is in our operator hierarchy, so right click on <B>wander</B> and 
select <B>Open Rules</B>.
<P>
Since all our tank is going to do is wander, we will make that the only 
proposal.
<P>
Note: only proposals for operator wander go into the wander operator file. 
These rules must match against the top-state.
</P>
<CODE><PRE>
sp {propose*wander
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name Alphonse)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;)
   (&lt;o&gt; ^name wander)
}
</PRE></CODE>

<P>
You can check this production against the data map to see if there are any mistakes.
</P>

<H4>Specifying behavior for wander</H4>

<P>
Since wander is a high-level goal, we need to decide exactly what is 
wandering. I decided on the following behavior:
</P>
<OL>
  <LI>if either the radar or shields are on turn them off 
  <LI>move in a straight line if possible 
  <LI>if the tank can't move in a straight line then turn left or right 
  whichever is open 
  <LI>if neither left or right is open then turn around, by turning left 
</LI></OL>
<P>
Each one of these will be its own operator:
</P>
<OL>
  <LI>powerdown 
  <LI>move 
  <LI>turn 
  <LI>turn-around 
</OL>

<P>
So right click on wander and select <B>Add a Suboperator...</B> from the context 
menu, and type in <B>powerdown</B>. Now do the same for <B>move</B>, <B>turn</B> 
and <B>turn-around</B>.

<P>
Next, we need to set up the DataMap for wander, since wander has suboperators 
it also has a DataMap, so right-click on <B>wander</B> and select <B>Open 
DataMap</B> and tile it with the top-state DataMap named Alphonse.

<P>
Since these are low-level operators, and they will perform actions using our
generalized application rules. We 
will need to create an actions attribute underneath each operator in the <B>wander</B> 
data map. To do this, expand <B>top-state</B> and <B>io</B>, ctrl-shift drag the <B>output-link</B>
to one of the <B>operator</B> attributes in the <B>wander</B> DataMap. Now, <B>operator</B> has an 
attribute named <B>output-link</B>, right-click on <B>output-link</B>, select 
<B>Rename...</B> from the context menu and type <B>actions</B> into the input dialog box.  Link this 
attribute value (ctlr-shift drag) to the rest of the operators.</P>

<P>Our concern in wandering is that we don't want to use any power. Visual Soar 
created an elaborations file, because <B>wander</B> is a subgoal. So open this 
<B>elaborations</B> file, and type in the following production
</P>
<CODE><PRE>
sp {wander*elaborate*using-power
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name wander
              ^top-state.io.input-link &lt;il&gt;)
   (&lt;il&gt; ^&lt;&lt; radar-status shield-status &gt;&gt; on)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^using-power true)
}
</PRE></CODE>
<P>
Now, add <B>^using-power true</B> to the <B>wander</B> DataMap.
<P>
Now we know if we are using power, so close <B>elaborations</B>, open 
<B>powerdown</B> and type in the following production:
</P>
<CODE><PRE>
sp {wander*propse*powerdown
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name wander
              ^using-power)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;)
   (&lt;o&gt; ^name powerdown)
   (&lt;o&gt; ^actions &lt;a&gt;)
   (&lt;a&gt; ^radar.switch off
        ^shields.switch off)
}
</PRE></CODE>
<P>
open <B>move</B>'s rule file and type in
</P>
<CODE><PRE>
sp {wander*propose*move
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name wander
             -^using-power
              ^top-state.io.input-link.blocked.forward no)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;)
   (&lt;o&gt; ^name move)
   (&lt;o&gt; ^actions &lt;a&gt;)
   (&lt;a&gt; ^move.direction forward)
}
</PRE></CODE>
<P>
similarly, for <B>turn</B> type in
</P>
<CODE><PRE>
sp {wander*propose*turn
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name wander
             -^using-power
              ^top-state.io.input-link.blocked &lt;b&gt;)
   (&lt;b&gt; ^forward yes
        ^{ &lt;&lt; left right &gt;&gt; &lt;dir&gt; } no)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt; + =)
   (&lt;o&gt; ^name turn
        ^actions.rotate.direction &lt;dir&gt;)
}
</PRE></CODE>
<P>
Finally, for <B>turn-around</B> type in
</P>
<CODE><PRE>
sp {wander*propose*turn-around
   (state &lt;s&gt; ^name wander
             -^using-power
              ^top-state.io.input-link.blocked &lt;b&gt;)
   (&lt;b&gt; ^forward yes ^left yes ^right yes)
--&gt;
   (&lt;s&gt; ^operator &lt;o&gt;)
   (&lt;o&gt; ^name turn-around
        ^actions.rotate.direction left)
}
</PRE></CODE>
<P>
Now we have finished our wandering Tank Agent. To be able to load our agent 
into TankSoar you must save it at least once. <B>Alphonse</B> is now able to be loaded into Tank Soar environment at 
<B>Alphonse.soar</B>.
</P>
