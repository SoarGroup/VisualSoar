The parser for Visual Soar is generated by javacc.
soarparser.jj is the source from which the
java classes are generated.  javacc contains
the actual executable along with docs and
lots of examples.

Addendum by Nuxoll (27 Oct 2022):

JavaCC in the Visual Soar respository may not work?

   Some (very old) javacc source code is included in the repository but I don't
   see any support in build.xml to actually rebuild it.  I note that there are
   batch files in parser/javacc/bin to build and run javacc.  These are
   (obviously) not going to work on a Linux or OS/X machine.  Also, they have
   hardcoded paths that I suspect are not in sync with the current Soar build
   environment.

   I had better luck just downloading the most recent version of JavaCC and
   using it.

Steps:
1.  Download/install javacc.  For me it was as simple as:
        sudo apt-get install javacc
    Once installed, navigate to the folder that contains it.

2.  The installation should include a javacc script (likely javacc.bat on
    Windows).  Run this command and verify that you get a usage message.

        javacc

3.  Run the javacc script on soarparser.jj.
        javacc xxx/VisualSoar/parser/soarparser.jj

    (where "xxx" is the directory that contains the Visual Soar repository.)

    This will generate these .java files:
        ParseException.java          SoarParser.java
        SimpleCharStream.java        Token.java
        SoarParserConstants.java     SoarParserTokenManager.java
        TokenMgrError.java

4.  Copy the generated .java files to your Visual Soar repositry:

         cp *.java xxx/VisualSoar/src/main/java/edu/umich/soar/visualsoar/parser/

5.  Rebuild Visual Soar and run.
